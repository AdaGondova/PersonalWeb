### Projects 

Description of some projects I've been working on: 

**Knowledge graph to identify patients susceptible to drug-induced interstitial lung disease**<br>
*Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, AZ*<br>
2018 - 2020<br>

- Extracted data from external and internal databases (PubChem, ChEdMBL, FAERS, clinical trialsâ€™ data); combine into a graph.
- Implemented ML-based graph completion model to predict rare adverse events for patients


**Improving patient testing in asthma population with AI-driven recommender**<br>
*Diagnostic Sciences at Precision Medicine, AZ*<br>
2018 - 2020<br>

- Analysed internal clinical datasets with focus on data harmonization, data imputation and feature selection to improve interpretability of resulting models. 
- Implemented and evaluated a tool to predict eosinophilia risk score.
- Gained understanding of challenges and opportunities associated with AI applications in late stage drug discovery and beyond.
- Communicated results to senior leadership & wider R&D community.

**Automated CMR image segmentation in rat with myocardial infarcts**<br>
*Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, AZ*<br>
2018 - 2020<br>

- Developed 3D convolutional network ensemble for segmentation of rodent cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images with automatic end-systole and end-diastole selection for quantification of ejection fraction. 
- Available internally as command line tool and web-based service.
- Work presented at 23rd Annual SCMR Scientific Session Feb 2020.

**MSc Bioinformatics: Dissertation Project**<br>
*The University of Edinburgh*<br>
2018<br>

RESEARCH PROJECT: *Small molecule target prediction using machine learning.*
- extracted known inhibitors from public assay datasets, generated training descriptor sets form SDF files, compared their suitability for target prediction.
- implemented and evaluated multiple supervised machine learning methods and deep neural networks.
- measured the performance against cheminformatic industry standards.

**BSc Biomedical Sciences (Neuroscience): Honours Research Project**<br>
*The University of Edinburgh*<br>
2017<br>

RESEARCH PROJECT: *Involvement of high-level prediction in visual awareness*. 
- studied effects of predictive context on the first dominant percept selection during binocular rivalry
- human participant recruitment and exclusion based on ocular dominance screens 
- development of new experiments to control for possible known biases (adaptation and response bias)
